# AI-voice-assistant

The more a person interacts with voice-activated devices, the more trends, and patterns the system identifies based on the information it receives. Then, this data can be utilized to determine user preferences and tastes, which is a long-term selling point for making a home smarter. Google and Amazon are looking to integrate voice-enabled artificial intelligence capable of analyzing and responding to human emotion.

Here, I've built an AI Assistant for me as a side project using just Python. The funny part is that I've named it on the name of my best friend "Rajat".
